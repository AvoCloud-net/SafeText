# SafeText
#### Developed by Red_Wolf2467

SafeText is an API server that checks texts for so-called bad words. SafeText is being actively developed and is used by our DiscordBot Baxi and our Minecraft plugin AvoFilter. 
SafeText works with the help of the Levenstein, the results of which are made available by the API.
